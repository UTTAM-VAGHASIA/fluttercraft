# FlutterCraft CLI - Bugs Fixed & Improvements

## Overview
This document details all bugs fixed and improvements made during the CLI redesign.

---

## Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. ❌ **No Multiline Input Support**
**Problem**: The CLI used simple `Prompt.ask()` which doesn't support multiline input or advanced features.

**Solution**: Implemented `prompt_toolkit` with full multiline support, auto-completion, and history navigation.

**Files Changed**:
- `utils/beautiful_prompt.py` (new)
- `commands/start.py` (rewritten)

---

### 2. ❌ **Flutter Version Not Dynamically Updated**
**Problem**: When running `flutter upgrade`, the header showed the old version until CLI restart.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented automatic version re-checking after `flutter upgrade`
- Header refreshes with new version while preserving command history
- Shows proper message: "Your Flutter version is already up to date" when current

**Files Changed**:
- `commands/command_handler.py` (new)
- `utils/beautiful_display.py` (new)

**Example**:
```
Before: Flutter version: 3.32.6 (Latest version available: 3.35.6)
After:  Flutter version: 3.35.6 (Your Flutter version is already up to date)
```

---

### 3. ❌ **Inconsistent Command Parsing**
**Problem**: Mix of string matching, command parts, and inconsistent handling of arguments.

**Solution**: 
- Centralized command handling in `CommandHandler` class
- Consistent parsing for all command types
- Proper argument extraction for complex commands

**Files Changed**:
- `commands/command_handler.py` (new)

---

### 4. ❌ **Clear Command Doesn't Preserve Header Properly**
**Problem**: The `clear` command cleared everything including version info, requiring manual refresh.

**Solution**:
- `/clear` now preserves header with current version information
- Clears only command history
- Maintains accurate system state

**Files Changed**:
- `utils/beautiful_display.py` (new)
- `commands/command_handler.py` (new)

---

### 5. ❌ **No Slash Command Support**
**Problem**: Commands used traditional syntax, not modern slash-based commands.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented full slash command support (`/quit`, `/clear`, `/help`)
- Backward compatible with old syntax
- Clear distinction between system and user commands

**Files Changed**:
- `utils/beautiful_prompt.py` (new)
- `commands/command_handler.py` (new)

---

### 6. ❌ **Limited Command History (20 commands)**
**Problem**: History was limited to 20 commands and not properly managed.

**Solution**:
- Increased to 50 commands
- Proper history preservation during header refreshes
- Smart history clearing with `/clear` command

**Files Changed**:
- `utils/beautiful_display.py` (new)

---

### 7. ❌ **Poor Error Handling**
**Problem**: 
- Ctrl+C would exit the CLI
- No graceful handling of interruptions
- Unclear error messages

**Solution**:
- Ctrl+C now cancels current input without exiting
- Ctrl+D provides quick exit
- Clear, helpful error messages with suggestions
- Proper exception handling in main loop

**Files Changed**:
- `commands/start.py` (rewritten)
- `utils/beautiful_prompt.py` (new)

---

### 8. ❌ **No Auto-Completion**
**Problem**: Users had to remember and type full commands.

**Solution**:
- Implemented intelligent auto-completion
- Suggests commands as you type
- Tab completion for all commands
- Context-aware suggestions

**Files Changed**:
- `utils/beautiful_prompt.py` (new)

---

### 9. ❌ **Inconsistent Help System**
**Problem**: Help commands were scattered and inconsistent.

**Solution**:
- Centralized help display
- Consistent formatting
- Command-specific help with `--help` flag
- Comprehensive `/help` command

**Files Changed**:
- `utils/beautiful_display.py` (new)
- `commands/command_handler.py` (new)

---

### 10. ❌ **No Visual Feedback for Long Operations**
**Problem**: Commands like `flutter upgrade` showed no progress.

**Solution**:
- Loading indicators for long operations
- Real-time output display
- Success/failure messages with icons (✓/✗)
- Status updates during execution

**Files Changed**:
- `commands/command_handler.py` (new)
- `utils/terminal_utils.py` (existing, used properly)

---

## Minor Bugs Fixed

### 11. ✓ **Exit Command Inconsistency**
**Before**: Only `exit`, `quit`, `q` worked
**After**: Added `/quit`, `/exit`, `/q` slash commands

### 12. ✓ **Version Display Formatting**
**Before**: Inconsistent version message formatting
**After**: Standardized format with color coding

### 13. ✓ **Command Echo in History**
**Before**: Commands weren't properly echoed before output
**After**: Clear command echo with `fluttercraft>` prefix

### 14. ✓ **FVM Version Update**
**Before**: FVM version didn't update after install/uninstall
**After**: Header refreshes automatically after FVM changes

### 15. ✓ **Empty Command Handling**
**Before**: Empty commands caused unnecessary processing
**After**: Silently ignored, no error messages
