## üõ† Current Commands 

### `fluttercraft start`

### FVM Management Commands

FlutterCraft provides a set of commands to manage Flutter versions through FVM (Flutter Version Manager).

#### `fvm install`

Installs Flutter Version Manager on your system.

```bash
fvm install
```

* On Windows, uses Chocolatey (will offer to install if not present)
* On macOS/Linux, uses curl to download and run the installation script
* Requires admin privileges on Windows

#### `fvm uninstall`

Uninstalls Flutter Version Manager from your system.

```bash
fvm uninstall
```

* Will ask if you want to remove all cached Flutter versions
* On Windows, uses Chocolatey
* On macOS/Linux, uses the FVM installer script with --uninstall flag

#### `fvm releases`

Lists all available Flutter SDK versions that can be installed through FVM.

```bash
# List all stable versions (default)
fvm releases

# List versions from a specific channel
fvm releases beta

# List versions with explicit channel flag
fvm releases --channel dev

# List versions with short channel flag
fvm releases -c all
```

Available channels: `stable` (default), `beta`, `dev`, `all`

#### `fvm list`

Lists all installed Flutter SDK versions managed by FVM on your system.

```bash
fvm list
```

* Shows cache directory location and size
* Displays details for each installed SDK
* Highlights which version is set as global/local
* Sorts versions by release date (newest first)

### Help System

FlutterCraft includes a comprehensive help system:

```bash
# Global help

# FVM-specific help
fvm help

# Command-specific help
